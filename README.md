Laptop Price Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts laptop prices based on their specifications. This repository is designed to help both buyers and sellers estimate the fair market value of laptops by inputting hardware and software features.

üöÄ Features
Accurate Price Estimates: Predicts laptop prices using advanced machine learning algorithms.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed for quick and easy input of laptop specs.

Comprehensive Data Analysis: Utilizes a dataset covering numerous brands and configurations.

Customizable: Extend and improve the model with your own data and features.

üìä Project Overview
Laptop prices vary widely across brands and configurations. This project uses regression techniques to forecast prices, learning from real-world data on:

Brand and model

Processor (CPU) type and speed

RAM size

Storage type (SSD/HDD) and capacity

GPU details

Screen size and resolution

Operating System

Weight and additional features (e.g., touch screen, IPS display)

The aim is to help users determine a laptop‚Äôs fair price, improve purchasing decisions, and bring pricing transparency to the market.

üßë‚Äçüíª Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.7+

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

ML Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest (may vary depending on model implementation)

Interface: Streamlit/web or Jupyter notebook (implementation-specific)
